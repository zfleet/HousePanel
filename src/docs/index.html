<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>HousePanel (HP) is a user-hosted (typically local) highly customizable open source
web application dashboard for accessing and
controlling a SmartThings or Hubitat equipped smart home from a Tablet, 
Computer, or even Smart Phone.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel" target="_blank">Download</a> a copy of 
HousePanel from the <a href="https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel" target="_blank">
    HousePanel GitHub repository here.</a>

<p>HP is designed to give the user full control over the look and feel of their panel controller.
It does require some effort to install and configure, but once set up, making fine tunings
and adjustments are relatively simple.  Most customizations can be done from within
the built-in web-based user interface, which includes a full featured tile editor and
a tile customizer for modifying content shown on any tile. Power users can also make
major modifications by editing a CSS file using industry standard protocols.</p>

<p>HousePanel now supports multiple user configurations. Any number of users
    can be defined with their own password. Each user's setup can be customized
    individually to meet their needs. When a user logs in, only their configuration
    will be shown on the tablet.</p>

<p>HP runs on a customer-provided web server and does not expose your personal data
nor any details about your environment to the developer or any other party.
You are in total control. The default settings were designed by a professional web designer
to create a highly acceptable user interface for non-technical people. 
It is designed to not look and feel "geeky". By default the tiles 
are large and colorful, placed on beautiful full color backgrounds.
There is also a modern skin that makes HousePanel look very similar to 
other popular dashboards. Finally, the user can create any number of custom
skins to make HousePanel look however they desire.</p>

<p>As of version 1.990, HousePanel also includes a helper Node.js application that
pushes the status of things to your dashboard in real time as they change
due to user control outside of the panel. This feature requires installation
of HousePanel on server located on the same network as your hub. Typically this
will be a Raspberry PI but it can be any server that supports Node.js and that
can be accessed locally by the smart hub. If activated this feature will provide immediate updates
to your dashboard as opposed to waiting for the once-a-minute poll to update it.
</p>

<p>A relatively new feature of HousePanel is the ability to display Album Art
of the currently played musical track. This has been tested to work with
Sonos and with Amazon Echo devices using the Echo Speaks 3rd party application.
There is no special setup required. Just play your music and HP will find
the proper Album Art and show it in the tile. This uses Google search so it
your dashboard will not run all locally when you use music tiles.</p>

<p>An advanced feature of HP is that it can be used as a text-based web service to return
json strings of status about your home to any other web application. This advanced
feature is mostly for developers and can be safely ignored, but if you are a developer
then you should read the final section of this Wiki on Advanced Applications of HP.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
HousePanel can display and/or control most types of things in a smart home 
ecosystem, including:
<ul>
    <li>switches 
    <li>dimmers 
    <li>bulbs 
    <li>lights (deprecated)
    <li>momentary buttons
    <li>contact
    <li>doors 
    <li>locks 
    <li>presence
    <li>thermostats 
    <li>temperature sensors 
    <li>illuminance sensors
    <li>motion sensors 
    <li>water sensors 
    <li>valves (sprinklers)
    <li>smoke
    <li>power
    <li>music
</ul>

A number of special tiles are also supported, including: 
<ul>
    <li>Smart Home Monitor (SmartThings only)
    <li>Hubitat Safety Monitor (Hubitat only)
    <li>blanks 
    <li>clock
    <li>images
    <li>mode
    <li>routines
    <li>weather
    <li>frame (great for weather forecasts)
    <li>WebCoRE pistons (SmartThings only)
    <li>video
    <li>custom
</ul>

Images can be any still or dynamically updated graphic that can be referenced
via the Internet in the CSS file. Blanks are spacers and can take any form or size, giving the user
maximum flexibility in the layout of the pages. A relatively new capability
of HP is the ability to include user-defined iFrame tiles. These are tiles
that can contain any content from anywhere on the web using iFrame browser capabilities.
To use this feature you will need to create a local "html" file with your
desired iFrame content. By default HP comes with two html frames that shows
a weather forecast in two different formats.
<br/><br/>

Most tiles now also contain 4 fields hidden by default that display the last four
events that occurred and their date in the UTC time zone. One or up to all four
of these fields can be revealed using the tile editor or by adding the following
to your skin (more on skins later).
<br/><br/>
<blockquote><pre>
div.event_1 {
    display: block;
    font-size: 9pt;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: rgba(90,90,90,1);
    font-style: italic;
}
</pre></blockquote>

A very important feature of HousePanel is the Tab layout. All controllable things are presented on one
of several Tabs that can be quickly swapped in and out of view. This uses the tabbed display capability
of modern web browsers. Under the hood HP uses jQuery to make this efficient. This means that any
number of pages can be displayed, and on each page, any number of "things" can be shown
and controlled. Later in this document we will explain how to customize the names of pages and
the number of pages used. A default page configuration is provided but pages can be
easily renamed, deleted, or added when in Edit mode.
<br /><br />

For advanced users HousePanel is a highly flexible API that can
serve as a web service to access your smart home devices from another web application. 
This works for SmartThings and Hubitat connected devices.
This feature requires that users first authenticate their hubs using the GUI.
API calls are possible without using prior GUI authentication if the user knows and
provides the fairly complex URL-encoded security codes on the API command line.
Instructions for using the API are in the advanced section of this document.
<br/><br/>

The main page of HousePanel once installed and configured will look something like this:
<div><img src="mainpage.png"></div>
<img src="authpage.png" alt=""/>

<h2>Requirements - What You Need to Use HousePanel</h2>
HousePanel is a web application written in PHP and Javascript that is 
paired with a SmartThings and/or Hubitat SmartApp written in the Groovy language.
There is also an optional small Node.js module used to push status info
to the dashboard in real time. If this module is installed, your panel will stay
in sync with the status of things in your home in near real time. Otherwise
HousePanel uses polling to keep things in sync, so there can be up to a one
minute delay before your dashboard is updated to match external changes. Any state
change made on the dashboard itself will always be immediately shown correctly.
<br/><br/>

To use Housepanel you will need a modern browser that supports HTML5 and Javascript.
Obviously you will also need a SmartThings and/or Hubitat
account with owner access. You will also need to have owner access to a web
server of some type capable of hosting PHP applications. Access to a good CSS 
editor will also be useful but is no longer essential given the robustness of
the integrated tile editor. If you do plan on editing CSS directly to make custom changes to your
HousePanel configuration, you can do this with any text editor, but you will
be much happier if you are using a coding editor that assists you with the crazy syntax
of CSS and graphical aids for color selections. I personally use NetBeans which is
my favorite coding editor. You can get a copy from the Oracle website 
at <a href="www.netbeans.org">www.netbeans.org</a>. If you do use 
NetBeans be sure to install the plugin for PHP editing. 
I also find the color code preview plugin to be useful for picking colors easily.
Again, most users won't need to worry about this because the look and feel of
HousePanel can be controlled using a proviided in-app tile editor (more on that later).

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h2>Server Options and Instructions</h2>

<h3>Option 1 - Raspberry Pi (Best Option)</h3>
This is by far my favorite and the strongly preferred option. This is the only
option that supports a test and confirmed implementation of the ability to update
things on the panel in real time when things change.
Raspberry Pi single board hobby computers are perfect
for projects like HousePanel. This is because they take up very little space, use a small amount of energy,
and they are relatively easy to configure. Unlike a dedicated computer, a Raspberry Pi can be neatly tucked
away just about anywhere and go un-noticed. To use this option you will need to first of all own a Raspberry Pi
and you will need to know how to manipulate it and program it. There are many web tutorials out there
that show you how to do this. When you install a rPi for use with HousePanel I recommend that you use
a fixed IP address so that you know where to find it every time. This can be accomplished in several ways. The
easiest way is to use your router to tell it to give your rPi a fixed IP based on its Mac address. Next you will
need to have the Apache web server installed on the rPi. The recipe below will point you in the right direction
but if you get stuck please refer to any number of online tutorials about how to set up a rPi and install
both Apache and PHP.<br/><br/>

Start by either connecting your rPi to a monitor and keyboard, or logging into it remotely using SSH. If
you are using a PC I recommend using the "putty" program for SSH. It can be downloaded for free.
You may need to first use a monitor and keyboard to enable SSH.
Once you are logged into your rPi use the following commands to configure Apache with PHP.
<br />

<blockquote><pre>
sudo raspi-config
     > Interfacing Options > SSH then enable
     > Change the default timezone. 
 </pre></blockquote>

I recommend changing the default password from "raspberry" to whatever you want.
Then you should "ssh" into your rPi as username = pi and password = your-password
modify /etc/defaults/keyboard to be a "us" keyboard and not the default "gb".<br/><br/>

A new install script is available. To use this, log into your rPI with SSH and enter this:

<blockquote><pre>
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kewashi/HousePanel/master/install.sh
bash ./install.sh
 </pre></blockquote>

This should configure Apache, PHP, cURL, download HousePanel, set permissions, and
restart Apache. Once you do this you should be all set and ready to run HousePanel<br /><br />

You can also do a manual install following the steps below. To do this, 
enter the next several lines to install the Apache and PHP applications onto the rPi.<br/><br/>

For PHP 5 use the following commands:<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 php5 php5-gd wiringpi raspi-gpio rpi-update --fix-missing
sudo apt-get -y install curl
sudo apt-get -y install php5-curl
sudo rpi-update
</pre></blockquote>

For PHP 7 use the following:<br/><br/>
<blockquote><pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install apache2 libapache2-mod-php php php-gd wiringpi raspi-gpio rpi-update --fix-missing
sudo apt-get -y install curl
sudo apt-get -y install php-curl
sudo rpi-update
</pre></blockquote>

Next, you need to confirm that PHP is setup to use cUrl. This should be on by default 
because of the install lines above, but check php.ini to be sure.
Look for your php.ini file and then edit it using nano or vim. Within php.ini
search for "curl". You should find a line that loads the curl library. Sometimes
that line is commented out with a "#" in the first column. If your file has this,
activate the loading of the curl library by uncommenting that line. 
<br><br>

Finally, restart Apache using:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
sudo service apache2 restart
</pre></blockquote>

Another reason I like the rPI option is because you can run a number of other
services on a rPI that enhance the functionality of HousePanel. For example,
I have KuKu Harmony and Homebridge both running on my rPI side by side with
HousePanel. Installing those apps are beyond the scope of this doc.

<h3>Option 2 - Dedicated computer on your LAN</h3>
This option has great flexibility and speed. It is secure because it runs on 
your LAN and is typically not exposed to the Internet. Your home
router shields all computers from the Internet from outside access 
unless you bypass that using either DMZ or port forwarding. The 
disadvantage is you can't access this server unless you are at home 
and on the same network. This can be a big restriction but many people 
don't control their smart homes using a panel when they are away, so 
I personally don't think this is a major limitation. To use this option
you will need to have a web server installed on your dedicated computer, 
and you will need to leave that computer on at all times that you want 
the panel to work. Instructions for installing Apache on a
dedicated home PC or Mac can be found at http://www.apache.org <br/><br/>

You will then need to install PHP on your web server and enable cUrl. 
Instructions for doing this are beyond the scope of this Wiki. You 
can find excellent instructions and examples for how to do this all over the
Internet. As with the public web server option, you will also need to 
set the permissions of the directory where you want to install 
HousePanel. Since this is a local computer you can do this using standard
methods for your local computer. On a PC this involves right-clicking on the directory and setting
permissions. But first you will need to create the directory within your web hosting area.
For example, make a directory called "housepanel" under c:\htdocs on a standard Apache install. I have
not tested HousePanel on IIS but it should work fine.<br/><br/>

<h3>Option 3 (not recommended) - A public facing hosted web server</h3>
This option is perhaps the simplest but has major security issues than
the other two options. It will also respond much slower because all commands including
polling to keep your panel current requires messages to be sent over the Internet.
Using this option is <strong>STRONLY DISCOURAGED</strong> for these reasons.
If you must use this option you should protect your website with some type of security
such as a password and a robots file to prevent it from being discovered by search engines.
HousePanel now has a simple built in password feature that should help here, but it
is not industrial strength so caution should still be exercised with using this option.
<br/><br/>

To use this option you need to create a directory on the server
that hosts your public-facing web pages, such as "housepanel". For the purposes of this documentation
we will assume that the directory name is "housepanel". You can use any method you like to do this
but the easiest is probably using a full-featured FTP program. An important step before proceeding
is to set the permissions of that directory to enable write access. How this is done depends a lot on
what type of server you are using. Most public web servers are Linux and Apache based in which case
you can use chmod 777 on the directory. Some FTP programs will support this, others won't. You may need
to use the file browser function of your web hosting service to change the permissions to "777" which means
the owner, groups, and the world can read and write to the folder.<br/><br/>

<h2>Testing your PHP Web Server</h2>
Before proceeding I highly recommend that you test your web server
and confirm that it works with PHP and cUrl. To do that load the file
phpinfo.php into a browser window. This file is included in the
primary repo folder. For example, let's assume you are using a
rPi on static IP address 192.168.1.50 and your HP is installed in /housepanel
then you would browse over to: 
http://192.168.1.50/housepanel/phpinfo.php
<br/><br/>

If things are working you should see a PHP information page returned. Scroll
down and look for a section named cUrl to see if it is activated. The HP distribution
files that we will download later includes a phpinfo.php file so if you
prefer you can wait and perform this test after uploading the files, in which
case you won't have to worry about creating this file.
<br/><br/>

If loading this page generates an error, then you know your web server was
not installed correctly and it will need to be addressed before you can proceed.
Detailed troubleshooting of the install steps for Apache, PHP, and cUrl
are beyond the scope of this Wiki but there are ample resources on the
web that can help you troubleshoot this and get it working before you proceed.

<h2>Installing the HousePanel Application</h2>
There are two groovy files that are used to operate HousePanel - one for SmartThings
and one for Hubitat. The SmartThings version is called HousePanel.groovy
and it should be installed into your SmartThings smartapp IDE repository.
The Hubitat version is called HousePanelHubitat.groovy and it should be
installed into your Hubitat IDE on your local LAN.<br/><br/>

<h3>SmartThings SmartApp Installation</h3>
Unfortunately I was not able to get the SmartThings IDE option to work with my account
so you will have to install this manually. 
First, open the HousePanel.groovy file from the following GitHub account:
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
<a href="https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel">https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel</a>
</pre></blockquote>

With this file open click on the "raw" icon in the upper right corner.
This will open a window showing just the "raw" lines of code. Copy the entire file
to the clipboard using Control-A or Command-A on mac, then Control-C or Command-C on a mac.
Navigate back to your ST IDE at graph.api.smartthings.com. Make sure you are
logged in. Then go to the SmartApps section using the top menu. Click on create
new SmartApp then select "from code". In the blank window that opens, paste
the code that you copied to the clipboard here using Control-V or Command-V
on a mac. Then select Save  then Publish "for me".<br/><br/>

If you are an experienced GitHub user you can also feel free to just clone
or fork your own copy into your GitHub account and work with it from there.
The advantage of this is you can track and manage any local edits you make
and GitHub will do all of the work of managing your changes for you as usual.
The other advantage of that approach is if you make improvements, you can
contribute them to the Open-Dash movement by making a pull request. I would
appreciate seeing such community contributions that will of course
help make HousePanel get much better over time.<br/><br/>

Before you leave the ST IDE, you will need to 
enable OAUTH2 in the IDE app settings. To do this, select App Settings
and turn on OAUTH2 in the options. This will reveal two long strings 
of data called CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET. 
These values are important and must be copied and saved for use in the
next step when you are configuring your web server.<br/><br/>

After you have installed HousePanel.groovy in the IDE, you need to load an
instance of the app on your smartphone using the SmartThings app. You must use
the legacy SmartThings app to install HousePanel. When you load the app you will
be presented with a few options, followed by a list of things to select. You can select
them here or you can wait and select them when you authenticate the hub from
the main application side. Either works with SmartThings.

<h3>Hubitat App Installation</h3>
If you are a Hubitat user, you will need to install the HousePanelHubitat.groovy
file into the app section of the Hubitat webpage API. Open the
HousePanelHubitat.groovy file from the following GitHub account:
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
<a href="https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel">https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel</a>
</pre></blockquote>

With this file open click on the "raw" icon in the upper right corner.
This will open a window showing just the "raw" lines of code. Copy the entire file
to the clipboard using Control-A or Command-A on mac, then Control-C or Command-C on a mac.
Navigate back to your Hubitat IDE on your local LAN. 
Create a new App "from code" and name it HousePanel.groovy.
DO NOT name it HousePanelHubitat.groovy. In the blank window that opens, paste
the code that you copied to the clipboard here using Control-V or Command-V
on a Mac. Then select Save.<br/><br/>

Before you leave the Hubitat Apps Code page, you will need to 
enable OAUTH. To do this, click on the OAUTH button in the upper right corner
of the Hubitat IDE page. This will open a window showing two long strings 
of data called Client ID and Client Secret.  
These values are important and must be copied and saved for use in the
next step when you are configuring your web server.<br/><br/>

After you have installed HousePanel.groovy in the Apps Code area, you need to load an
instance of the app in the Apps area near the top. When you load the app you will
be presented with a few options, followed by a list of things to select. 
With Hubitat hubs you must select the things you want to include in your dashboard
at this time. When you authenticate the hub later, you will only be asked if you
want to give permission to HousePanel to access Hubitat. With Hubitat you will not
be given the option of changing what things you permit during the authentication step.
<br><br>

<h3>Multiple Hub Considerations</h3>
You can install either the SmartThings or Hubitat hub or both of them. They
play nice with each other so you can use both together or one or the other. This feature
is a great way to make a gradual transition from SmartThings over to Hubitat.
As of Version 1.80, any number of Hubitat and SmartThings 
hubs can be connected to the panel. Hooks are there for Wink and OpenHab support which will 
come with time. I'm excited about this because I wrote this generally enough to 
make future hub bindings easy to add. As of this writing, HousePanel has not been tested
to work with multiple SmartThings hubs on the same account. Users have reported problems
with trying to do this. However, multiple SmartThings hubs on different accounts appear
to work fine. Also, multiple Hubitat hubs have been reported to work properly.
<br/><br/>

<h3>Install PHP Code on Web Server</h3>

In this step you will install the PHP application by copying the
files from the following GitHub into a directory of your choice:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
    <pre>
    <a href="https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel">https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel</a>
    </pre>
</blockquote>
<br/>

If you used the new install script to set up your rPI, then this step is already done.
<blockquote><pre>
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kewashi/HousePanel/master/install.sh
bash ./install.sh
 </pre></blockquote>

Once you have done this you should be all set and ready to run HousePanel.
The following is only if you want or need to do a manual install.<br /><br />

A typical place to install HP is in its own directory called "housepanel" within
your html folder, typically located at /var/www/html. 
Be sure to preserve the directory structure when you upload the 
files to your web server. Also, make sure you copy ALL of the files to
your web server. The .groovy files, python examples, LICENSE, and README files are not 
needed but it won't hurt to have them on your web server as a backup copy, 
so I would just copy all the files. You also can skip copying the "docs" 
sub-directory but again, it won't hurt to be there. If there, you will be able
to pull up a local copy of this doc file from your dashboard.
If you are using FTP to transfer files, please be sure to use a binary
transfer protocol. <br/><br/>

Again, you can also fork this to your own GitHub space
and then clone it down to your local PC or Mac if you are familiar with using GitHub. 
If you are using Git on your local PC I recommend this approach since it
will allow you to make local edits and pull requests for any improvements
you want to be considered. As a bonus, if you are using NetBeans editor
that editor talks nicely to Git to tell you what edits have been made
using visual cues.<br/><br/>

Earlier versions of HousePanel required the creation of
a file named "clientinfo.php".  This file will still be used if created
but it is no longer required. If you have a copy of this file from an older
installation, it is strongly recommended that you remove it. For now the code
will attempt to use it, but this feature may be removed in the future.
<br/><br/>


<h3>Hub Push Node.js Installation</h3>

This section describes how to install the optional Node.js hub push middleman feature.
You should install the rest of HousePanel and authenticate your hubs before attempting
to install this feature. For this feature to work you must have Node and Npm installed. 
If your server is a rPi, log into it using ssh and enter the following commands to install Node and NPM.
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb 
sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
</pre></blockquote>

Alternative instructions for installing Node.js and npm can be found here:
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
https://www.instructables.com/id/Install-Nodejs-and-Npm-on-Raspberry-Pi/
</pre></blockquote>

Regardless of which method you use, you should check to make sure you have 
Node.js installed properly by running the following command:
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
node -v
</pre></blockquote>

Next, you will configure the app called housepanel-push.js <br><br>

The main GitHub repository contains a version of housepanel-push.js in the housepanel-push sub-folder. To use
this you must first configure it using the npm package manager to load all of the
required dependencies. Navigate to the housepanel-push subfolder and enter:
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
npm install
</pre></blockquote>

Test your application by running it on the console:
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
node housepanel-push.js
</pre></blockquote>

If successful the app will read your hmoptions.cfg file and report statistics about your setup.
If you have not yet installed the rest of HousePanel this will indicate that and hibernate
until it finds a valid config file. Either way, this flags that you have the app working
so you should stop it by hitting "Control-C". Next you will install it as a service. To do
that start by editing the provided housepanel-push.service file and change the WorkingDirectory and
Execstart lines to point to the location where you have HousePanel installed on this server.
<br><br>

<blockquote><pre>
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/html/smartthings/housepanel-push/
ExecStart=node /var/www/html/smartthings/housepanel-push/housepanel-push.js
</pre></blockquote>

In the above line, for example, you should change "smartthings" to "housepanel"
if you installed HousePanel in the /var/www/html/housepanel folder. Save this file,
change its permissions, and launch the service as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
sudo chmod 777 housepanel-push.service
sudo chmod 777 housepanel-push.js
sudo systemctl enable housepanel-push
sudo systemctl restart housepanel-push
</pre></blockquote>

Sometimes the Node.js setup is stubborn and refuses to load. You should check to
make sure that housepanel-push is running in the background after you install
it as service. That can be done by doing:

<blockquote><pre>
ps -aux | grep housepanel
</pre></blockquote>

You should see the housepanel-push service running. If not, something went wrong
and you will have to do some troubleshooting. Detailed troubleshooting is beyond
the scope of this documentation. Please visit the forum for further assistance.
If you see it running in the background, then congratulations, you have it set
up properly and it will push status over to HousePanel.
<br><br>

I realize this is a lot of configuration to deal with. The install.sh script
attempts to automate this for you. It works for some people but it is not
completely robust so it might fail, in which case the details above should help.
Over time I will continue improving the install.sh script to make it more robust
and foolproof.
<br>

<h3>Set Server Permissions</h3>
This step ensures that your web server can create and update as needed
an options file that is generated dynamically when you run HousePanel.
To do this you will need to either SSH into your server or use a FTP
program that allows file permissions to be established and edited. If you are
using Option 3 then FTP is your best bet. Alternatively some web hosting
services provide separate tools for setting permissions. Whichever method
you use, the directory where you installed all the files must be set to
read/write. In Linux/Unix terminology this is done using "chmod 777 /housepanel"
assuming your directory name is /housepanel. If you are using Option 2
then your local web server configuration tool should be used to set
the directory to read/write. If you are using Option 1 - Raspberry Pi - then your
best option is to SSH over to the Raspberry Pi and then use the Linux
command "chmod 777 /var/www/html/housepanel". Replace the directory name
here with where your Apache stores html files and the name of the
directory where you installed the HousePanel files.

<h3>Final Check</h3>
If you have made it this far, you are ready to do an initial test. Before
you do, let's review things to confirm that you have the following set up.
A lot of people have forgotten the cURL step, so don't forget that. If
you are missing anything, you should go back to the relevant section
and complete that step:<br/><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Web server set up with PHP configured
    <li>Confirmed that cUrl is activated in your PHP
    <li>either... HousePanel.groovy installed in your SmartThings IDE with OAUTH activated
    <li>and/or... HousePanelHubitat.groovy installed in your Hubitat IDE with OAUTH activated
    <li>known values of Client ID and Client Secret for all hubs you want to activate
    <li>known value of API host for all hubs you want to activate and Hub ID for Hubitat
    <li>HousePanel files from <a href="https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel">https://github.com/kewashi/HousePanel</a> uploaded to its own directory on your web server
    <li>the directory above configured to read/write using "chmod 777 yourdirectory"
    <li>HTML5 capable Web browser with javascrpt and cookies enabled
    <li>Node middleman running, tested using ps -aux | grep housepanel
</ul>
<br/><br/>

If all of the above is true, you are ready to run HousePanel for the first time.
Before trying this on your Tablet or Cell phone, confirm that it loads
properly in a desktop browser. I have tested HousePanel with Chrome
(on a PC, iPhone, iPad, and Android tablet),
Microsoft Edge (on a Windows 10 PC), 
IE 11 (on a Windows 7 and Windows 10 PC), 
Safari (on a Mac and iPhone), Silk on an Amazon Fire table, and Fully Kiosk Browser (on PC, an
Android tablet, and an Amazon Fire tablet). All have been confirmed to work but others are
likely to work as well. Fire tablets work as well if you use the APK to load Fully Kiosk Browser.
The Silk browser works but it lacks a full screen mode and videos don't load properly.<br /><br />

Fully Kiosk, Chrome, and Edge work the best in my experience. 
Before testing make sure Cookies and Javascript are enabled.
Browse to the web server that you installed in the first step and the directory
where you stored HousePanel. Using the same name examples we have been using
throughout this guide, that would be:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
    http://192.168.1.50/housepanel/housepanel.php
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

If all goes well, HousePanel will launch and display an authentication page.
If this happens, congratulations - you are ready to proceed. 

<h1>Running HousePanel</h1>

<h2>First Time Launch - Authenticating</h2>

When you first launch HousePanel, the following authentication page 
will be displayed for you to provide your credentials and other setup information:

<div> <img src="authpage.png"> </div>

The first input section is where you specify your timezone, your default skin
directory, your username, and a password. If you don't want to use passwords
to protect your panel, leave it blank. Empty passwords mean anyone with physical
access to your home panel can load HousePanel and control your home.
Multiple users can be defined, each with their own unique Username. If this
is your first time running HP, use admin and proceed with authenticating your hubs.
You can return to this page later to add additional usernames. When you add a new
username later, you can skip the hub auth step and go to the Done button. For now,
proceed with identifying your default main user (I recommend leaving it as admin)
and giving a password. Then proceed with selecting your first hub and hub info below.<br><br>

This authentication page is also where you will provide the API Url,
Client ID and Client Secret information from the OAUTH settings noted earlier.
Note that if you provided a clientinfo.php file, these values will be pre-populated.
The Hub Name field is optional and will be filled in automatically for SmartThings
and Hubitat.<br><br>

Hub ID is a unique identifier for this hub that is user provided. Hubitat hubs
will populate this field with the hubid of the hub. The user must provide a unique value
for SmartThings hubs. This field will be populated with a good guess.<br/><br/>

The Fixed Access Token and Fixed Endpoint values are optional. If provided
you do not have to provide the Client ID and Client Secret values. You also will
not be redirected to an auth challenge page. This option is provided for those
who know their tokens and don't want to bother being challenged every time
to enter their credentials when doing a reauth. Otherwise, to proceed you must provide
the Client ID and Client Secret values. You also ALWAYS have to provide a valid API Url address
Typical values for the API Url are:
<br/><br/>

<table>
    <tr><td>SmartThings:</td><td>https://graph.api.smarthings.com</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hubitat Local:</td><td>Your local IP address of your Hub, such as http://191.168.1.50</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hubitat Cloud:</td><td>https://oauth.cloud.hubitat.com</td></tr>
</table>

If you want local processing for Hubitat use the local version. If you want to be
able to use your panel anywhere use the cloud version. 
Once these are provided, select "Authorize Hub" and the app will redirect you 
to the Hub's page. For local Hubitat processing
there is no auth challenge. For the cloud versions you will have to provide your login information,
and then you select all of the devices that you want HousePanel to control.
Your login information should be the same information you use to 
access the SmartThings or Hubitat account online.<br/><br/>

It is this authentication step that prevents anyone
from accessing your HousePanel installation. This is why it is important to
protect this login information; otherwise, anyone who has it will also be
able to access your HousePanel and control your smart home. On the other hand,
if you installed HousePanel on a Raspberry Pi on your home local network, then
only people with access to your home network will have access to HousePanel.
This gives you one extra layer of protection and is why I prefer the
Raspberry Pi installation option (see Option 1 in Section 1). This same
extra layer of protection exists for Option 2 installations on a PC or Mac with 
a web server, but such a server must stay on and can be more easily accessed
via a keyboard than a rPi that has been tucked inside a cabinet. Anyway, 
enough preaching about the benefits of the rPi install. <br/><br/>

SmartThings hubs will present
a list of your hubs. Select which hub you want to associate with HP. Most
people only have 1 hub so there isn't any decision to make here, but you will
still need to explicitly click on the one hub that you have. I have two hubs
so in my case I have to pick the one that I want to control. Anyway, after you
click on the hub, or in the case of Hubitat, after you authenticate,
all supported things will be shown in a list. For local Hubitat installs the
list of things must be selected when you install the app. The authentication step
will only ask you to authorize access with Hubitat.
<br/><br/>

This is where you select which things you want HousePanel to have the
option of displaying and controlling. <strong>IMPORTANT!!</strong> I am saying the
"option of" here because HP does not have to display everything you select here.
It is just that ONLY the things selected here will be possible to display.
The way you select what is displayed where and how they are displayed will be
described in the next few sections. What I recommend doing here is to just
select everything that is supported in the most intuitive category. 
For example, dimmer switches will show up on both the switch list and
the switchlevel list. I would select it only on the switchlevel list, but you can do both.
You might decide to exlude some devices. For instance, I excluded a light that I have in my
food pantry that is activated by a door open sensor, since I don't
ever anticipate needing to turn the lights on in a closed food pantry. Anyway,
just select the things you want and you will be good to go. To finish this step click
on the Save button at the bottom of the screen. Again, this applies only to SmartThings
because Hubitat requires the things to be selected when you install the app. This same
approach can be used with SmartThings where you select the things you want from the
smartphone SmartThings app. If you do that, the things you selected on your smartphone
will be selected by default when you authenticate the hub.<br><br>

You will then be redirected back to this same Authentication page where the number
of devices read will be shown for the hub you selected. At this point you can
authorize another hub following the same procedure. Just select the hub you want from
the "Authorize which hub" drop down list and proceed accordingly. If you want to add
a hub then select the last item which is always a new blank hub.
If you are done authorizing hubs, select the "Done Authorizing" button at the bottom
of the screen. This will show you the main HousePanel page and you'll be ready to start
enjoying your panel. Sometimes when you return from the auth page a Refresh is
needed for your new things to show up. Just reload your browser or click the Refresh button.<br/><br/>

When the HousePanel main dashboard loads the first time, it reads
all things that you selected and their states. It then assigns unique
ID numbers to each thing, it automatically organizes each thing selected into
one of several pre-defined rooms. That information is then saved in a file
called hmoptions.cfg onto your server. In our example case, it
will be stored in: "/var/www/html/housepanel/hmoptions.cfg". As an aside,
this is why you had to do the step of making your server directory Read/Write.
Without that setting HousePanel will not be able to save this file. If all goes well
HousePanel will then render the page and display it to you. It will look
something like:<br/><br/>

<div><img src="family.png"></div>

If you are curious how HousePanel decides what thing to put in which room by
default, here is how it does it. First, HP creates seven default rooms 
named Kitchen, Family, Living, Office, Bedrooms, Outside, and Music.
Then it places and activates any thing whose name contains one of several
keywords into the corresponding room. The keywords are listed below
separated by "|" for the rooms noted. This keyword map can be found in the
housepanel.php source code in the setDefaults function roughly around line 2770.
If you are comfortable with editing source code, feel free to change these
keywords to your liking; however, end users will have other ways of moving
things around and renaming rooms using the graphical editor. 
We'll discuss how to use this editor to edit, add or delete things and rooms in a later section.
<br/><br/>

<table>
    <tr><td>Kitchen:</td><td>   "kitchen|sink|pantry|dinette|clock|mode" </td></tr>
    <tr><td>Family:</td><td>    "family|mud|fireplace|casual|thermostat|weather"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Living:</td><td>    "living|dining|entry|front door|foyer"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Office:</td><td>    "office|computer|desk|work"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bedrooms:</td><td>  "bedroom|kid|bathroom|closet|master|guest"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Outside:</td><td>   "garage|yard|outside|porch|patio|driveway"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Music:</td><td>     "sonos|music|tv|television|alexa|stereo|bose|samsung"</td></tr>
</table>

<h1>Using HousePanel</h1>
Your default HP page should look something like the image in the prior
section. Before getting into how to customize things, lets first explore how to use
HP to get the most out of it. Most of it will be obvious and intuitive, but
a few hidden gems require explanation. For starters, you can browse different
rooms by clicking on any tab at the top of the page. Notice that the room
display changes INSTANTLY! This is because HP renders all pages in advance
and organizes them into tabs. When you select a different tab you are just
telling HP to show that tab that was previously created.<br/><br/>

<h2>Turning Things On and Off</h2>
While on any page, you can click or tap on any thing tile to change its state.
For example, clicking on "Kitchen Light" will turn the light off if it is
on, and will turn it on if it is off. If you click on a closed garage door, it will open.
However, not all things support state changes from HP.  Contacts, motion sensors,
clocks, and blanks are display only tiles so clicking on them will do nothing. 
Tiles that invoke actions include switch,
bulbs, lights, dimmers, garage doors, mode, routines, shm (SmartThings), hsm (Hubitat), 
thermostats, and music tiles. 
If you are using a computer, the cursor will change to a pointer when
you hover over things that can be clicked to change state.<br/><br/>

Some tiles such as thermostat and music tiles have multiple controls that can 
be individually controlled by clicking on them. 
For example, each thermostat has a heater and an AC control
and each one has up and down arrows that can be clicked on to adjust
the temperature setting. On music tiles, play, pause, skip, and stop 
can also be clicked on. On dimmer tiles you change the intensity 
of the light by moving the slider. When you do this
the light will always come if it is off.<br/><br/>

If you have the browser control panel open (F12 on Chrome), clicking on things will return
status information to that screen. This is a great way to see if your panel is working
properly.

<h2>Edit Mode: Moving Tiles Around</h2>
One of the most exciting features of HousePanel is the ability to highly
customize its look and feel. The first level of customization involves
simply moving existing tiles around on a page. To do this, you need to enter
edit mode using the Edit radio button on the bottom right corner of the screen.
When you are in this mode, tiles can be moved around freely on the page
by clicking and dragging them with your mouse or finger. While edit mode is
fully supported on a tablet, I strongly recommend that you do edits on a PC
and then deploy your edited configuration to your tablet by simply doing a Reload.
When in edit mode you can also rename pages, add pages, delete pages, add tiles using
drag and drop from the library, delete tiles, and edit individual tiles in detail. 
When editing page names, please be advised that page names cannot contain spaces. You
should also avoid the use of symbols in page names. Tile names can contain spaces
and symbols but I recommend keeping things simple.
Edit mode will look something like this:<br/><br/>

<div><img src="editmode.png"></div>

The green dots on the page tabs are used to edit the page in the Tile Editor. The red dots are
clicked on to delete a page. Similar green and red dots are shown on each tile 
for entering edit mode or to delete that tile. If you select a red dot to
delete a tile or page, you will be prompted to confirm. Upon confirmation the tile will be
removed from the room being displayed. If you select a green dot on a tile, the Tile Editor will launch.
The blue dot will launch the Tile Customizer. 
Tile Editor and Tile Customizer are documented in later sections.  

<h2>Reorder Mode: Changing Order of Rooms and Tiles</h2>
You can select Reorder mode to enable the reordering of tiles and rooms.
The main difference of this mode is things are automatically snapped into
place in this mode based on the order. This is also the only mode that
allows room tabs to be moved around into a different order. To do this,
simply click and hold a tab and move it left or right
to reorder your rooms. The new room location will be permanent on this server.
IMPORTANT!! You can mix edit and reorder mode, but you should first do reorder
and then do edit to make fine tuning adjustments. If you reorder after you edit
the relative positions will no longer be applicable so they are reset to zero.
If you mistakenly do this, just click Refresh and the page will render properly.

<h2>Adding or Removing Things from Rooms</h2>
Deeper customization involves adding or removing things to your rooms. 
One way to do this is to use Edit mode described above. While in Edit mode
a catalog will display on the right hand side. You can drag things from this
catalog and drop them on the page. A confirmation box will appear - click on Yes
to confirm addition of the dropped tile. <br><br>

An easy way to make
multiple changes to multiple rooms at the same time is to use the Options page.
This page is launched using the Options button found at the bottom left of the page.
Clicking this button will load a page with a
two-dimensional matrix of all your things and all your rooms that looks
like this:<br/><br/>

<div><img src="options.png"></div>

Everywhere you see a check mark means the thing of that "row" will
be shown in the room of that "column". If you have a large number of things
you can filter showing things by type by clicking on the check boxes on
the top of this page. You can add or remove a check
mark in any room for any thing. Duplicates are allowed. For example, at one
extreme, if you want all things to show in all rooms, you would just
check all of the boxes. This wouldn't make any sense but hopefully this
extreme example indicates the tool's extreme flexibility. A more realistic
example might be to check a thing with a name that didn't match one of
the default keywords, or to uncheck a thing that matched that you don't
want shown in the default room. For example, in my installation I added a
check to "Back Yard Rock" to the Outside room, and removed the
"Garage Entry Door" from the Outside room. I also checked the clock row
for every room so I have a clock on all pages.
You should also notice that the hub number and type of each thing is shown
in this table.<br/><br/>

<h1>Customizing HousePanel</h1>

<h2>Styling Tiles Using TileEdit</h2>
Some amazing work done by @nitwit in the SmartThings community inspired the
development of a robust tile editor in HousePanel that can be used to modify
the look of just about every element of every tile. To use the editor, select
"Edit" mode in the radio buttons near the bottom of the page. Each tile will then
show a green, blue, and red dot. 

<div><img src="editdots.png"></div>

Red will delete the tile,
Blue will open the Tile Customizer described in the next section,
and Green will open the following Tile Editor page.

<div><img src="tileedit.png"></div>

This window can be dragged around on the screen such that you
can see the effects of edits made on the main screen immediately.
Tile editor use is self-explanatory as it uses standard 
dialog box features. To style a particular item, first click on it 
in the tile display or you can select the item from the drop down list below the tile.
Some items are hidden and can only be selected from the drop down list. For those
items you can select them and then unhide them and style them however you like.
The icon background will style the entire tile. So if you want an image background
on a tile, select "whole tile" and then pick the image you want. 
The on or off state of some tiles can be toggled by clicking on the main icon. Some
tiles have multi-state icons such as thermostats. Each click rotates to the next state.<br/><br/>

There is even a gradient background feature to add some flair to your tiles. 
The icon can be selected from
your local subdirectory or it can be taken from a library of standard Android icons.
There is also a directory called "media" where you can load any custom images. By
default this directory contains a number of interesting backgrounds you can use.
This is how I used my photo in the presence tile.<br/><br/>

I think you will enjoy tinkering with this feature. If you are more of a power
user and want to fully control your own destiny, keep reading for how one would
style the page using custom written CSS. One other thing is worth noting -- if you use
the tile editor feature, HousePanel will create a file named "customtiles.css" containing the styling
information specified. This file should not be edited directly. You can save this file
and create a library of profiles for later use. There are lots of options here.
If you want to customize your setup, you should make those custom edits in
the housepanel.css file in your skins directory following the instructions below.

<h2>Styling Pages Using Tile Editor</h2>
Pages can now be edited using the Tile Editor, so strictly speaking the Tile
Editor is now both a tile and a page editor. To use this feature click on the
green dot next to a page tab when in Edit mode. When the editor launches for a page
a simple box is shown with the name of the page and two links for styling
the tab itself. The tab color when selected and when not selected can be changed
here. You can also put an icon in the tab using this feature and change its outline.<br><br>

If you select whole tile option then the page background image or color can be selected.
You can also change the border, apply gradients, and other effects as you wish.
You can also still manually edit page backgrounds in the CSS using the
directions below.<br><br>

<h2>Customizing Tile Content</h2>
Tile content can also be altered using the built in Tile Customizer in HousePanel.
To use the customizer, select "Edit" mode in the radio buttons near the bottom of the page. 
Clicking on the blue circle will open the Tile Customizer page that looks as follows:

<div><img src="customize.png"></div>

The Custom Type option in the upper left is used to pick what type of customization
you are performing. Seven options are available: TEXT, POST, GET, PUT, URL, LINK, and RULE.
TEXT links are used to add any user provided text to the tile. When adding anything
to the tile, you must name the field in the User Field Name area on the left.
You can also select an existing field, in which case your text will show up
instead of the default behavior that this tile normally shows. Be careful with
this feature because it can remove important functionality. Then again, this flexibility
means you can make all sorts of creative effects.<br><br>

POST, GET, and PUT types are used to add a user-specified web service to the tile
being customized using the method selected. In the top of the right column, 
enter a valid URL to the web service. You must also either pick the field 
this will override OR give a new user-defined field name using the entry 
box on the left. Click the "Add" button and this field will be added to the 
list of "Existing Fields" shown on the left side of this dialog box. 
You can mix and match this with any other addition.<br><br>

URL types are similar to POST, GET, and PUT except it opens the given URL
in a new window. The text entered must begin with http for this to work.
TEXT fields will behave like URL fields when a valid URL is provided.<br><br>

LINK types enable you to add any other field in any other tile in your smart home 
to the tile being customized. In the top of the right column, select the tile to 
link to, and then select which field of this tile to link into the customized tile 
using the "Available Fields" list above on the right. Once you are happy with your 
selection, click the "Add" button and this field will be added to the list of "Existing Fields" 
shown on the left side of this dialog box. You can mix and match this with any other addition.
Note that with LINK customizations the field name must be taken from the linked tile.
If you link in a switch field from another tile, it will replace the existing switch field.
If you attempt to link in another switch field, it will overwrite any existing one unless
you alter the field name by adding some custom text after the word switch.
For example, you could make this field name switchtwo. This only works if there is
already a linked field named switch.<br><br>

RULE types provide a simple automation capability. The rule is provided as a single
line of text representing the tile number you want to control, the field, and the type
of action you want to take. These three values are separated by an equal sign. Any
number of rules can be entered separated by a comma or semicolon.
For example, to turn on tiles 42 and 60 that are both switches you would enter:<br><br>
<blockquote>
42=switch=on, 60=switch=on
</blockquote>

More complex rules are allowed such as setting level and mixing on and off. For
example, the following will open a garage door, set the level of a dimmer,
turn one light on, and turn another light off.<br><br>
<blockquote>
42=switch=on, 16=door=open, 60=switch=off, 51=level=30
</blockquote>

To use this rule feature you need to have the tile numbers that you want to control.
Tile numbers can be obtained from the Info page.<br><br>

The Tile Customizer is a powerful tool for making custom panels. The tile shown
above for example was made by adding a switch, a slider, a smart home monitor,
and a close time field to a blank tile. Once these fields are added they take on
the style of their parent, but that can be modified using the Tile Editor 
described in the prior section.

<h2>Macros</h2>
Macros are a more powerful alternative to automation than the RULE system
provided by the Tile Customizer described in the previous section. With Macros
you can string together any number of action calls that HousePanel supports
and connect it to any field on any tile. The catch is there is no GUI for 
defining Macros. Macros must be hand-written and saved in your hmoptions.cfg
file, so this is a feature only for power users. Macros are defined in a section
of the hmoptions.cfg file called "macros". That section looks something like:

<blockquote><pre>
"macros":{
"custom|custom_4|test":
[
  ["-","adcd1-12345-4a33-c111-11223ea123","switch","switch","toggle"],
  ["-","dcba9-54321-4cda-a222-223344abcd","switch","switch","off"],
  ["-","dcba9-26371-5cda-b333-65432abcda","switchlevel","level","on","60"]
]
}
</pre></blockquote>

The keys are a string composed of the type, the id, and the field, separated by the "|" symbol.
The type|id pair is the "connected tile" that is used to trigger the macro.
This should be one of the tiles listed in the "index" section of the hmoptions.cfg file.
The field specified is the field that is clicked on to invoke the macro.
An array of arrays follow. Each array entry has up to 6 fields. The first array element
is the hub id. If "-" is entered, the hubid of the connected tile is used. The second
element is the id of the thing to automate. The third element is the type of thing. The fourth
element is the field to control. The fifth element is the command or value to pass to HP.
For example, it could be "on", "off", "open", or "close". A sixth element is attribute
that is sent for some tiles to be controlled. For example, level can be sent this way.<br><br>

Any number of macros can be defined and they can be tied to anything, including custom fields
as is shown in the above example. The only restriction is they cannot be mixed with RULE
custom fields.<br><br>


<h2>Styling Things Using CSS</h2>

The following several sections are legacy methods for styling HousePanel. 
These methods should only be used if you can't get the Tile Editor to do what you want.<br /><br />
An important type of customization is performed by either creating your
own custom style sheet or editing the provided one in the "skin-housepanel"
directory. When you unpack or clone the master source files this directory
will exist underneath the master root location where you installed
HousePanel. It is best to keep a local copy of all files to edit and then
upload them when you are ready to your server. If you are using NetBeans then
that IDE can handle uploads for you automatically if you set up the project
files with your FTP username and password. Doing this is beyond the scope of
this Wiki but you can find instructions in the NetBeans help file. To begin
customizing open the housepanel.css file in your favorite text
editor. That file will have many well designed defaults for most types of
HTML classes and tags that you will find in the displayed webpage. In the
following sections we define how you would alter some of these settings.

All tabbed pages inherit the property of the "div.panel" style that is
defined in the default CSS file. The default should look something like this:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.panel {
    display: inline-block;
    border: 0px solid #3333cc;
    padding: 2px;    width: 100%;    margin: auto;
    position:relative;    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: left;
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 41px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.50);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

So if you want all pages to by default to be squeezed onto 75% of the page
you could change "width:100%" to "width:75%".<br/><br/>

Each specific tabbed page is identified by a &lt;div class="panel-name"> style with the name
"panel-" pre-pended to the name of the page shown on the tab. Case is not
significant when doing this styling. For example, the Kitchen
page is tagged with div.panel-kitchen. This is the setting one would alter
in the CSS file to provide a unique styling for any page with the tab
named "kitchen". The default styling is defined here:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.panel-family, div.panel-familyroom {
    background-image: url('family.jpg');
}
div.panel-kitchen, div.panel-dinette {
    background-image: url('kitchenroom.jpg');
}
div.panel-formal, div.panel-living, div.panel-livingroom {
    background-image: url('formal.jpg');
}
div.panel-outside, div.panel-garage {
    background-image: url('outside.jpg');
}
div.panel-office, div.panel-library {
    background-image: url('office.jpg');
}
div.panel-bedroom, div.panel-bedrooms {
    background-image: url('bedroom.jpg');
}
div.panel-music, div.panel-theater, div.panel-entertainment {
    background-image: url('music.jpg');
}
div.panel-thermostats, div.panel-thermostat {
  background-image: url('thermostat.jpg');
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

If you want to change the background image just provide your custom image
and upload it to your server and refer to it in the above section of the CSS.

<h3>Default Thing Styling</h3>
All things displayed in HousePanel inherit the styling tied to the
&lt;div class="thing"> tag style. 
The default should look something like this:<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.thing {
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 3px;
    text-align: center;
    vertical-align: top;
    border-top: 2px solid #999999; 
    border-right: 2px solid #333333;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #333333; 
    border-left: 2px solid #999999;
    background-color: rgba(0, 51, 204, 0.6);
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 7px black;
    color: rgba(250, 250, 250, 1);
    cursor: default;
    width: auto; 
    height: auto;
}    
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

If you want all tiles displayed to be a different size or have a different border
color, this is where you would specify your custom information.

<h3>Specific Thing Type Styling</h3>
Any given thing has a known thing type and each type can be styled distinctly.
This is done by providing styling information tied to the
&lt;div class="thingtype"> tag, where thingtype is one of the recognized types
of things that HousePanel supports. For example, if you wanted to make all
things of type "switch" look a certain way, you would style the following block:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.switch {
    width: 118px;
    height: 112px;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

This would just style the switch portion of the tile. Each tile also has
a title bar and potentially other elements. The entire tile can be styled by
referencing "div.thing.switch-thing". This approach will take priority over
anything you provided previously to "div.thing" described above, but only
for switch things. For example, let's say you wanted to put a photo of your
cat into all switch things, you could do that by doing something like:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.thing.switch-thing {
  background-image: url('mycat.jpg');
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

<h3>Styling Things Based on State</h3>
Things in HousePanel that can be clicked upon typically also change state.
The current state of all such things is available to be used to provide
state based styling. The most common example of this is a switch, which changes
the styling "div" to include "on" or "off" based on whether the switch is
on or off in state. Using this one can provide a unique image or unique color
styling based on whether the switch is on or off. The default CSS uses this
to style "on" switches to use a bright light bulb, and "off" switches to use
a dim light bulb.
<br/><br/>

Notice that this styling applies to switches, dimmers, bulbs, and lights.
Any image styling provided in the div.switch section will be overridden by this.
This same concept applies to open and closed doors, momentary buttons that are
pushed, and locked and unlocked locks. Other single word states provided by
the SmartThings system will be available to use for styling.

<h3>Thermostat, Music, Weather, and other Complex Formatting</h3>
The principles and concepts described above apply equally well to thermostats
and music thing tiles. The difference is that these tile types involve
more complex multi-part elements. The important thing to note is that each individual
element can be styled individually or all of them can be styled using the master
div information that wraps around the entire tile. For thermostats, the 
master div information is tagged with div.thing.thermostat-thing 
following a similar pattern as the simpler tiles. This applies to all complex
tiles such as Music and Weather tiles. 
The following styling from the default file presents the temperature
reading as a blue-green circle. This can be changed to whatever you prefer.
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.thermostat.temperature {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 118px;
    background-color: #006666;
    color: #ffffee;
    border: 2px solid white;
    box-shadow: 5px 4px 15px black;
    cursor: default;
    text-align: center;
    height: 50px !important;    width: 50px;
    padding: 4px 3px 0 3px;
    margin-top: 10px;    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    font-size: 20px;
    line-height: 45px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 50%;
    -moz-border-radius: 50%;
}
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Customizing Special Things and Tiles</h2>
HousePanel includes a number of special things/tiles that are by default styled
appropriately; however, in keeping with the flexibility principle of
HousePanel, all of them can be customized to your liking. The custom
tiles and how to customize them are described below.

<h3>Blank Tiles</h3>
Blanks are just that - blank. They are used as spacers. Four blanks
are provided for SmartThings hubs and a different set of four blanks
are provided for Hubitat hubs. Any of them can be added to any page using the Options feature
described previously. All blanks are styled as transparent in a
standard tile size. The div tag used to style all blanks is
div.thing.blank-thing so this div can be 
styled to make blanks look differently. For example, one might want
to use blanks as dividing lines to separate tiles into sections.
The four SmartThings blank sizes are provided under the names
b1x1, b1x2, b2x1, and b2x2. The Hubitat blanks have the names
h1x1, h1x2, h2x1, and h2x2. The names indicate the default sizes of
these four blank tiles using the following default styling:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.b1x1, div.b1x2, div.b2x1, div.b2x2 {
    width: 120px;    height: 160px;
    font-size: 0px;    padding-left: 0px;
}
div.b2x1, div.b2x2 {
    width: 244px;
}
div.b1x2,div.b2x2 {
    height: 320px;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

The above makes b2x1 a double-wide, b1x2 a double-high, and a
b2x2 a double wide and double high tile. 
Again, these four default sizes can be changed to whatever you like.
For example, all four can be made the same size and then the gap size
can be driven by how many of them you include on any given page.

<h3>Clock Tile</h3>
HousePanel has a built-in digital clock and a built-in analog clock tile
both of type "clock".
The digital clock thing is a digital clock tile that by default shows
the day of the week, the date in MMM dd, yyyy format, and the time
in hh:mm AM/PM format. The overall clock tile can be styled using the
Tile Editor or manually by modifying
the div tag div.thing.clock-thing. By default this
element is styled to be a 246x160 blue tile but it need not be.  
All three sub-items can be styled in the editor or by using the tags:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.clock.weekday
div.clock.date
div.clock.time
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

The actual format of the sub-item fields cannot be modified using CSS, 
but it can be changed using the Tile Customizer by editing the 
fmt_date and fmt_time fields. These fields are not displayed but contain
text telling HousePanel how to format the date and time fields that
are displayed. Their contents can be adjusted using the TEXT feature
of the Tile Customizer. For example, you can specify "g:i:s" as the
fmt_time field and time will show seconds and drop the AM/PM.
The default fmt_time value is "g:i A"<br><br>

The font, color, size, and placement are all fair game to change in the 
Tile Editor. The overall
tile size can be styled using div.thing.clock-thing. Finally
this tile has a name bar just like all others, but by default it is
hidden. It can be displayed and uniquely styled using the tag name of
div.thingname.clock.<br /><br />

The analog clock is a round faced analog clock that uses a third party 
javascript plugin. The clock style cannot be modified using the editor,
but the size, color, and background can all be modified as with other things.<br /><br />

<h3>Image Tiles</h3>
Four place-holder image tiles are provided for end-user unique styling for
each hub that is authenticated.
These tiles are named "img1" through "img4" for SmartThings hubs
and "himg1" through "himg4" for Hubitat hubs. THey are styled using
the div tag div.thing.image-thing. By default
this styling is a double-wide tile that forces the image to stretch
to fill the tile (using background-size: cover). Each individual
image tile is where one would provide the online asset containing
the graphical image to display. For example, the img1 tile would be
styled to display a "jpg" file using the following:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.image.url.img1 {
    background-image: url("livingroom.jpg");
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

In the above example the jpg file must be on the same server as
the HousePanel app and in the same directory as the CSS file, but
any valid Web URL can be provided here. The other three img tags
can be similarly styled.<br/><br/>

<h3>Video Tiles</h3>
Four video tiles are provided for end-user custom display of video files
stored on the server. These files must be named video1.mp4 through
video4.mp4 and stored in the media folder. This is the top-level media
folder, not the media folder inside of each skin's folder. Any file named
video1.mp4 will be played in the video1 tile. Same for video2 through video4.
When the tile is clicked, the video will replay. Note that this is not
a live camera video feed - these are static videos only. However, you can
write a script to grab the latest video feed from your camera and save it
to the media folder with the appropriate name. This is how I view the videos
from my Arlo cameras. There is a sample script provided called getarlo-sample.py
that will save the latest video recorded by an Arlo camera to video1.mp4.
A second sample is provided called arlo-sample.py that will save the last
four videos to the media folder with names video1.mp4 through video4.mp4.
The next section describes frames that can be coaxed into displaying
live video feeds for some cameras. Examples are shown on the forum.

<h3>Frame Tiles</h3>
Four frame tiles are provided for end-user custom display of arbitrary web content.
These tiles are named "frame1" through "frame4". THey are styled using
the tag div.thing.frame-thing. By default
this styling points to a forecast web page in two styles.
Modifying frames requires a code edit in the housepanel.php file.
You should only do this if you are comfortable with coding.
Search for forecast.html or accuweather.html to locate where to make the changes.<br/><br/>

There are some amazing examples in the SmartThings community for how
to customize the styling of img tags to do things ranging from
live video feeds to 5-day forecasts. The sky is the limit. I encourage
you to browse the forum to get ideas for taking your HP to new heights.

<h3>Mode Tiles</h3>
Four mode tiles are provided that each can be used to show the
current state of the SmartThings location. This will be one of
the modes defined by the user in  the SmartThings app, such as
Home, Away, or Night. Mode tiles can be styled by modifying
the div tag div.thing.mode-thing. 
There are four mode tiles that parallel the naming convention
used for blank tiles: mode1x1, mode1x2, mode2x1, and mode2x2.
The default sizes are the same as their equivalent blank defaults.
Each mode tile contains three sub-items: mode.themode, mode.name,
and mode.zipcode. By default mode.zipcode is hidden. The actual mode
within the "mode.themode" sub-item is styled to be larger than the
name of the hub, which is in the mode.name sub-item. Again, these
sub-items can be uniquely styled or even hidden to your liking.

<h3>Routine Tiles</h3>
Routines are "Hello Home" actions that are defined in the mobile app.
These are presented as boxes without title bars by default.
The name of the routine is shown by default as simple text
in an 18 point font. The tag div.thing.routine-thing can be used
to create a unique look for routine tiles. Alternatively the specific
label sub-item under the div.routine.label tag can be styled. The latter
is what is in the default CSS.

<h3>Weather Tile</h3>
Of all the special tiles the weather tile is the most complex.
Unlike other tiles this tile is associated with a specific device
instead of with a generic capability. For this reason there can only
be one weather tile. This one weather tile can be displayed in any
or all rooms. If edited with the Tile Editor, the changes will reflect
on all weather tiles in every room. You can make it look different in 
each room because each room by editing the CSS directly because it
is wrapped with a room "div" tag that can be used as a qualifier.
The overall weather block is styled using the tags
div.thing.weather-thing and div.weather<br/><br/>

Weather tiles have many sub-items and each one can be uniquely styled.
The code block below is from the default CSS file showing just
one of many possibilities. Note that several sub-items are hidden
by default in this example. The outside temperature is shown using
a similar circle as is used with thermostat tiles.
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
div.thing.weather-thing, div.weather {
    text-align: center;
    height: auto;
}
div.thing.weather-thing {
    background-color: rgba(50,50,50,0.4) !important;
    width: 240px;
}
div.weather.temperature, div.weather.feelsLike {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 118px;
    background-color: #006666;
    color: #ffffee;
    border: 2px solid white;
    box-shadow: 5px 4px 15px black;
    cursor: default;
    text-align: center;
    height: 60px !important;
    width: 60px;
    padding: 4px 3px 0 3px;
    margin-top: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    margin-left: 10px;
    margin-right: 10px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    font-size: 20px;
    line-height: 55px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 50%;
    -moz-border-radius: 50%;
}
div.weather.feelsLike::before {
    content: "~";
}
div.weather img {
    margin-left: 15px;
    margin-right: 15px;
}
div.weather.wind::before {
    content: "Wind: ";
}
div.weather.wind::after {
    content: " mph";
}
div.weather.humidity::before {
    content: "Humidity: ";
}
div.weather.percentPrecip::before {
    content: "Rain: ";
}
div.weather.humidity::after, div.weather.percentPrecip::after {
    content: "%";
}
div.weather.sunriseset {
    margin-top: 10px;
}
div.weather.sunriseset, div.weather.humidity,
div.weather.wind, div.weather.percentPrecip, div.weather.alerts{
    background-color: #333333;
    margin-bottom: 4px;
}
div.weather.timeZoneOffset, div.weather.alertKeys,
div.weather.sunriseDate, div.weather.sunsetDate,
div.weather.illuminance {
    display: none;
}
div.weather.weatherIcon, div.weather.forecastIcon {
    display: inline-block;
}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

<h3>WebCoRE Pistons</h3>
WebCoRE is the wildly popular "Community Owned Rule Engine" by
@ady624 on the SmartThings forum. If you are a WebCoRE user then
you will see all of your WebCoRE pistons in the Options matrix
as described in a previous section. You will need to select the
pistons you want to display in the room columns where you want them
to show up. Once you do that they will appear in a style defined by
the tags: div.piston-thing, div.piston, div.piston.webcore, 
div.piston.pistonName, and div.piston.pistonName.firing.
The default shows a graphic that looks like an automotive piston
and when it is fired it looks like it is on fire.

<h3>Advanced Styling of Specific Tiles</h3>
Up to this point we have described how to manipulate and style
specific categories of things. In this section the overall format of the
rendering of things on the webpage is described. Using this information
one can uniquely style any one given thing or device. For example,
using the methods in this section it will be possible to style
a specific door using a unique icon (such as a barn door), 
while all other doors use a regular door icon. <br/><br/>

To understand how this works it is best to start with defining 
how all tiles are organized and accounted for. All tiles on the 
HousePanel webpage follow the following template. 
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div id="t-<b>n</b>" bid="<b>swid</b>" class="thing <b>type</b>-thing" p_<b>m</b> >
&lt;div id="s-<b>n</b>" class="thingname <b>type</b>" t_<b>m</b> > tilename &lt;/div>
<b>Loop i = 1 to N (</b>
  &lt;div id="a-<b>n</b>-<b>subitem[i]</b>" class="<b>type names[i] {subitem[i]} {status[i]}</b>" >
    content {status[i]}
  &lt;/div>
<b>)</b>
&lt;/div>
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

I know this looks intimidating, but it will make sense as we go through
each element and the nomenclature. First, everything in 
<strong>bold</strong> (except the Loop = 1 to N) is
a variable that changes with each thing and sub-item. 
Second, the <strong>type</strong>
variable is the type of the thing, such as switch, switchlevel, contact,
thermostat, weather, or piston. Third, everything 
inside of curly backets { } is optional and may not be present at all.
The rules for what shows up in the file and what doesn't are as follows:<br/><br/>

This template now includes a unique integer number prefixed with "p_"
where "m" is correlated with the native SmartThings ID number. 
The latter is a long complex string so it is probably easier 
to style HP using the shorter p_ number. This "p_" number is used
in the customtile.css file to provide the automatic customizations.
<br/><br/>

The title bar also includes a special class tag starting with "t_" and ending 
with "m" where "m" is a unique integer correlated with the ST id number. 
The {names[i]} parameter included in the class name 
represents the first three whole words taken from the name of
the thing.  For exmaple if I have a switch named "Kitchen Table Lamp Upstairs"
then the class for this item will include the words "kitchen", "table",
and "lamp" -- but not the word "upstairs". All words are converted to lower case.<br /><br />

The {subitem[i]} parameter is shown if and only if it is a different 
word than the thing "type". This is because the thing type is already 
included in the class name so this avoids listing it twice. 
The word "value" is also skipped if it is the first sub-type. 
This is done because subitems named "value" only happen when there is one 
and only one sub-type. 
<br/><br/>

The {status[i]} value is shown if it is a single state word such as "on", "closed",
or "locked". Multiple state values like song titles are not listed in the class. This
treatment is used to allow state-specific styling as described earlier.
For example, switches that are "on" will have the word "on" included
in the class name so that can be used to make on switches look different
than off switches. <br/><br/>

For example, the full class name of a switch named "Kitchen Table Lamp" 
that happens to be on will be "div.switch.kitchen.table.lamp.on".
If this same light is a dimmer of type switchlevel, the subitem representing
the switch itself will have a class name of 
"div.switchlevel.kitchen.table.lamp.switch.on". Note the addition
of the word switch. This is the subitem in the switchlevel thing.
The same "switch" word also existed as a sub-item in the switch thing
but it didn't get listed twice because the sub-item matched the type
so it was skipped.<br /><br />

An important side-note about switchlevel and bulb things. The level
sub-item is now rendered as a slider. The previous three part approach
is still there but just hidden so you can reveal it if you want. 
Each hidden level sub-item block looks as follows:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;div class="switchlevel level">
  &lt;div aid="n" subid="level" class="level-dn">&lt;/div>
  &lt;div aid="n" subid="level" class="level-val office main" id="a-n-level">75&lt;/div>
  &lt;div aid="n" subid="level" class="level-up">&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

By default these items are hidden and replaced by a slider that controls the level.
The Loop statement is intended to indicate that there are
potentially multiple "N" blocks that follow the shown template.
For example, in dimmer switchlevel things the value of N is 3 where
one sub-item is the switch and a second sub-item is the level. The
third sub-item is an indicator light that is hidden by default.
More complex tiles like Weather tiles have 
more sub-items so N will be larger.<br/><br/>

Finally, the parameter "n" shown in the template is a unique number
assigned to every visible element on screen. This is the number that
you must use if you want to style a specific thing to look different
than all other things of the same type and capability. You can find
this unique number by inspecting the visible thing in your browser or
by revealing the source code. Warning - the screen will be very messy
if you use the source code method. Once you know this number you can
style any specific sub-item using "#a-n-subitem[i]" or you can style
the entire tile using "#t-n" or "div.p_m" where "m" is the id number. 
Note that the first option is an "id" based styling in CSS and the id
can change as you add and remove devices. The div.p_m is a better approach
because it will be more stable as you add and remove items.

<h2>Manually Renaming, Adding and Deleting Pages</h2>

NOTE: This is no longer necessary because pages can be edited now
using the TileEditor, and multiple user configurations are handled automatically.
The following instructions will still work
for those wanting more fine grained control.<br><br>

Power users can also edit room names manually by editing the hmoptions.cfg file
and the default users hm_admin.cfg file. You will find these files in the 
home directory of your HousePanel configuration. 
If you are using multiple users, there will be a room configuration file
for each user that contains a subset of the master hmoptions.cfg file.
That user's file should be edited, not the master. The default user name is admin
so if you are ignoring multiple users, edit the hm_admin.cfg file. Otherwise
edit the hm_xxx.cfg file where xxx is the username's configuration you want to modify.<br><br>

This file is a direct write of the room and thing options in "json" format so care must
be taken to ensure that your edited file follows 
strict "json" formatting rules. Note that this file will not exist on
your local machine unless you download it first, because it is
dynamically generated by HousePanel when you run it for the first time
and it is updated every time you make an edit to the options. So download
the file and load it into your favorite editor. You will see the names
of the rooms listed in two places. You will need to make your desired room changes
in both places. When done, save the file and re-upload it to your server.
Make sure you update the permissions of this file after uploading to enable
writing privileges as described earlier.<br/><br/>

The file looks like this. 

<br/><br/>
<blockquote><pre>
{ "rooms": 
  {
    "Kitchen":0, 
    "FamilyRoom":1, 
    "LivingRoom":2, 
    "Office":3,
    "Bedrooms":4, 
    "Outside":5,
    "Thermostats":6, 
    "Music":7
  },
  "things":
  {
    "Kitchen":[113,107,193,47,16,50,25,79,87,104,103,139,109,102,168],
    "LivingRoom":[0,2,5,11,12,29,32,41,45,52,53,58,59,76,78,82,84,91,92],
    "FamilyRoom":[1,27,30,34,39,42,54,57,83,88,99],
    "Outside":[7,14,20,23,33,35,36,37,38,46,56,61,65,78,91,118,119,169,170],
    "Office":[10,[44,-25,35],80,101,131],
    "Bedrooms":[24,28,33,17,43,48,51,56,85,86,89,90,167],
    "Music":[60,63,64,68,70,99,100,101,166],
    "Thermostats":[102,167,168]
  },
}    
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

Actually, the "things" section now looks far more complex because it has
tile location and custom names in each item. The "rooms" info will be shown
on a single line, and the "things" info will be shown on a second single line,
so you need to preserve that too. If you don't know how to preserve
this then you should just stick with using the visual TileEditor.<br><br>

Each item in the "things" list can be a single
integer or an array of four integers plus a string. 
The first integer is the thing index in the master list. If there is an array then
the next two integers are offsets where the icon is physically displayed, the last integer is the z-index
and the string is the custom tile name. This is normally established
dynamically when tiles are dragged around screen but the user is free to edit
these.<br/><br/>

Important!!! Please be sure to confirm that your uploaded
hm_xxx.cfg and hmoptions.cfg files retain read/write privileges after you upload it.
Many FTP programs do not retain the permissions of files when they
are overwritten. Once you have made this change, you will need to force
a re-read of your things and the room configuration. The easiest way
to do this is to click the "Refresh" button on the bottom left of the main screen.
This will force the app to
re-load all of your rooms and things, so your new room setup will be active.

<h2>Kiosk Mode</h2>
To run HousePanel in Kiosk mode, first you will need to download a good
kiosk mode browser. I like the 
<a href="https://www.ozerov.de/fully-kiosk-browser/">
Fully Kiosk Browser</a> for Android or Amazon Fire tablets. For iOS iPAD tablets you will
have to research other options. You can also use Safari to then put the
page on the iOS desktop to create a Kiosk effect. Once you have that then
turning on kiosk mode will remove the Options button from the bottom of the
options page. On the options page, select the Kiosk option box.
Be aware that once you turn kiosk mode on the only way to turn it back off 
is to force HousePanel to display the options page again by entering:
<br/><br/>

<h1>Using HousePanel as a Web Service or EndPoint</h1>

This section is for advanced users who want to use HousePanel as a web service
to control their smart homes from other web or desktop applications.  
The possibilities are quite endless when one enables this, but be warned that
such endpoints if exposed to the open Internet would allow anyone
to control your smart home, so care must be taken to protect against this.
There is a tradeoff between ease of use and security here. The simplest approach
is to place your HousePanel app on your home Intranet on the "safe" side of
your router and firewall. Then you can feel free to enable the easy access options
that will be explained below. But even then nothing is fully secure so an
extra precaution one can use is to require the authentication variables to
always be provided when using the end point. Then again this means that information
is still traveling over your network, so even that isn't fully secure. The bottom
line is this feature does create some risk so just be aware of that if you proceed.
The reward for this nominal risk is a super rich API that can be called from
just about any other application using simple REST endpoint calls.
Let me reiterate this point, because it is quite profound! This feature will allow
you to write a complex and rich application using modern scripting
tools like Python to control your smart home. Keep reading to find out how.<br/><br/>

<h2>Getting Access and Endpoint Information</h2>
To use HousePanel as an EndPoint start by loading HP as usual and then
selected "Show Info" from the buttons on the bottom of the page. 
This will retrieve a page that gives you all the info you need to 
make the web service call using tools like Python or an EventGhost script.
The page returned will look something like this:

<div><img src="showinfo.png"></div>

<h2>HousePanel API Syntax</h2>
The syntax for calling the HousePanel API is:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=[doquery|doaction]&st_access=xxxx&st_endpt=zzzz
  [&id=abcd|tile=1234][&hubnum=num][&subid=thesubid]&type=thetype&value=thevalue&attr=theattr
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

where, <br />

<ul>
<li> either doquery or doaction must be provided
<li> abcd is the unique id of the tile
<li> 1234 is the unique tile number of the tile
<li> num is the hub index number. If omitted the first hub will be used
<li> xxxx is the full access_token returned by the useajax=showid call above
<li> zzzz is the full endpt returned by the useajax=showid call above
<li> thesubid is the optional sub element name to read or activate, such as "level"
<li> thetype is the type of thing, such as switch, motion, contact, thermostat, etc
<li> thevalue is a command such as on or off typically
<li> theattr is a settings value such as a number when dimming lights
</ul>

Either id or tile number must be provided, but not both. You also have the
option of providing an array of tile numbers or id's separated by commas
and each device listed will be acted on in a single API call.
The access and endpt values are optional if you have already authenticated HP.
Otherwise, you must provide these values on the API command line. 
To simplify making API calls your computer should be previously authenticated.
Note - previous versions of HP stored auth values in cookies. This is no
longer done. Instead the auth values are stored on the server in the
hmoptions.cfg file so API calls will always work if the hub was authenticated.

<h2>Calling the HousePanel API</h2>
Once you have the endpoint info above,
you are ready to use the API to turn on any switch, query any thing,
or do any other action that HousePanel knows how to do. 
There are two types of API calls: actions and queries. Actions are done
using "useajax=doaction" and queries use "useajax=doquery". So one would
use the API by submitting REST calls using strings that look like:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234...

or

yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doquery?id=abcd1234...
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

Of course you have to use the full id from the list returned by showid. 
The first call will toggle the switch matching the id. 
The second call will query any "thing" matching the id. 
You can use locks, momentary buttons, contacts, thermostats, and anything else 
supported by HousePanel in the above calls. The examples so far have all
used GET but POST works equally well and is more secure as it does not
visibly expose your endpoint information.<br/><br/>

When you use doaction for something other than a switch you have to also supply 
the "attr" and "value" variables. You can also provide a "type" variable
to speed things up, but if omitted the code will figure out the type
automatically. For example, dimmers are set using:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;value=on&amp;attr=40
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;amp;attr="level-dn"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;amp;attr="level-up"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&type=switchlevel&amp;value=on&amp;attr=40
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

Example 1 will set a dimmer to the 40% level. Example 2 will dim the light
by 5% and example 3 will raise the light level by 5%. Notice that we didn't
have to tell HousePanel the type of thing - it figured that out automatically.
Example 4 is identical to example 1 but will run slightly faster since it
skips the autotype logic in the code. You will probably not notice the difference.
Of course in all of these examples you have to supply the full and
correct id number instead of the place-holders shown.<br /><br />

Another option is to provide tile numbers that match the "p_m" values
and the code will lookup the complicated "id" nubers noted above. This is now
the preferred approach. So rewriting the first example, we would have:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?tile=12&amp;value=on&amp;attr=40
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

Thermostat temperatures can be modified similarly as shown below:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;attr="heat-dn"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;attr="heat-up"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;attr="cool-dn"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;attr="cool-up"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;value=heat&amp;attr="72"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;value=cool&amp;attr="76"
yoururl/housepanel.php?useajax=doaction?id=abcd1234&amp;amp;value=heat
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

If you are using a browser or other tool that can read the REST response, you will receive
a json string with the post-action status. The above examples performed on
a light dimmer return a string like this: {"switch":"on","level":75}.<br/>

More complex things return longer json strings. For example, 
thermostats will return the following type of result:
<br/><br/>

<blockquote><pre>
{"temperature":75,"heat":68,"cool":72,"thermofan":"fanAuto","thermomode":"cool","thermostate":"cooling"}
</pre></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

All things can be queried using doquery, but only types that can
be clicked or tapped on in the HousePanel web app support doaction. 
One important exception is motion sensors. To support the use case where one 
might want to "fake" the activation of a motion sensor, the API supports
sending "active" or "move" in the value parameter. This will set the
motion device type to active. Any other value sent will set it to inactive.
For this bit of magic to work, you must use a custom Motion Sensor device
type for any motion sensor that you want to trick this way. 
<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
The custom device type is called MotionZwaveManual.groovy and is found in the main 
folder of the HousePanel GitHub. Note that this only works on Zwave motion sensors
so please don't try this on the SmartThings ZigBee based motion sensors.
</blockquote>

One of the exciting things about this feature is it enables one to control
their smart home from apps like <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/">EventGhost</a>.
With this feature you can now tie HousePanel to any event invoked by your PC 
via the EventGhost application. For example, I use this to fake my office motion
sensor to think I am moving around in my office when I am typing.<br /><br />

If you are the adventurous type you can skip EventGhost and write your own 
Python application that interacts with your Smart Home. For example, you
can use the more flexible features of Python to write your own custom
smart applications complete with any logic you like to control your home. For me
I much prefer the logic and syntax of Python over Groovy so this will become
my scripting tool of choice for implementing sophisticated smart home features.<br /><br/>

The possibilities are endless.
